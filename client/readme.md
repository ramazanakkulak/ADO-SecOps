# Client - ReactJS

React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook in 2013. React is designed to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces for web applications. React has the ability to quickly update the interface when data changes.

## How it works

React manages the appearance of web pages using a structure called virtual DOM. Virtual DOM is a data structure outside the real DOM (Document Object Model) that holds a copy of it in memory. React calculates changes in the virtual DOM when data changes and compares it with the real DOM. After identifying the minimum differences between the virtual DOM and the real DOM, React only implements the changes in the real DOM. This allows web pages to be updated more quickly and efficiently.

```react
# create project
    npx create-react-app {your_app_name}
# start
    npm start
# build
    npm build
```
